<h4>Verse</h4>
<p>We were so beautiful<br>
We were so tragic<br>
No other magic could ever compare<br><br>
Lost myself, seventeen<br>
Then you came, found me<br>
No other magic could ever compare<br><br>

<h4>Pre-chorus</h4>
There's a room<br>
In my heart with the memories we made<br>
Took 'em down but they're still in their frames<br>
There's no way I could ever forget, mm<br>


<h4>Chorus</h4>
For as long as I live and as long as I love<br>
I will never not think about you<br>
You, mm<br>
I will never not think about you<br>
From the moment I left, I knew you were the one<br>
And no matter whatever I do<br>
Ooh, mm<br>
I will never not think about you<br><br>

<h4>Verse2</h4>
What we had only comes<br>
Once in a lifetime<br>
For the rest of mine, I'll always compare<br><br>


<h4>Pre-chorus</h4>
To the room<br>
In my heart with the memories we made<br>
Nights on Fifth, in between B and A<br>
There's no way I could ever forget, mm<br>

<h4>Chorus</h4>
For as long as I live and as long as I love<br>
I will never not think about you<br>
You, mm<br>
I will never not think about you<br>
From the moment I left, I knew you were the one<br>
And no matter whatever I do<br>
Ooh, mm<br>
I will never not think about you<br><br>

<h4>Bridge</h4>
Didn't we have fun?<br>
Didn't we have fun, looking back?<br>
Didn't we have fun?<br>
Didn't we have fun?<br>
Didn't we have fun?<br>
Didn't we have fun, looking back?<br>
Didn't we have fun?<br>
Didn't we have fun?<br>

<h4>Outro</h4>
We were so beautiful<br>
We were so tragic<br>
No other magic could ever compare<br>
